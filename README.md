# GraphsProject 

GraphsProject is a project motivated by one of the maths subjects of the degree ("GRAPHS" -- Open University of Barcelona ~ UOC).


For its development has been used: 
- org.graphstream library:http://graphstream-project.org
- j-text-utils: https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/j-text-utils
    
For the time being only Dijkstra, Prim and Kruskal algorithms can be compute.
